# Introduction
This Solar Panel Project is a class project for a Power Electronics class. The aim was to build a device related to power that can be used for personal use, is relatively inexpensive and simple to assemble.

This is what the completed circuit looks like:

# Current Status of this project:
At the moment this project doesn't quite work. When I was soldering parts onto the PCB something happened that fried my buck booster IC and as a result the entire section after the SPDT switch is rendered unusable since it feeds directly to the buck booster. If I connect my battery straight to the USB port and plug in a charger than it works just fine, but that defeats the purpose of the project.
